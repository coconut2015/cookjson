CookJson Documentation
======================

CookJson is an alternative implementation of `JSON API for Java (JSR 353) <https://jsonp.java.net/>`__.
Oracle's reference implementation, while efficient, is quite basic.
Additionally, its pretty `JSON <http://www.json.org/>`__ output is a bit odd, having
newline as the first character.

The primary motivations for this project are:

* Adding binary data handling.
* Adding the capability of combining streaming with tree models.
* Adding `BSON <http://bsonspec.org/>`__ support.
* Being extremely fast while having a small footprint.
