JSON
----

Parsers

* ``TextJsonParser`` - A JSON parser with Reader as input.
* ``UTFTextJsonParser`` - A *very fast* JSON parser specifically for UTF-8 input.

Generators

* ``TextJsonGenerator`` - JSON output with compact format.
* ``PrettyTextJsonGenerator`` - JSON output with indented format.

These classes are all public.  So you can either directly construct them or
use JsonProvider to create them.

It should be noted that the location unit returned by TextJsonParser is in
characters, while the location unit returned by UTFTextJsonParser is in
bytes.

Performance Tips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When parsing JSON inputs in UTF-8, use ``UTFTextJsonParser`` instead of ``TextJsonParser``.
It can be several times faster.

For example, instead of the following parser construction:

.. code-block:: java

	CookJsonProvider provider = new CookJsonProvider ();
	JsonParser p = provider.createParser (new InputStreamReader (new FileInputStream (srcFile), "utf-8"));

The parsing is far more efficient using the following approach:

.. code-block:: java

	CookJsonProvider provider = new CookJsonProvider ();
	JsonParser p = provider.createParser (new FileInputStream (srcFile), Charset.forName ("utf-8"));
