BSON
----
`BSON <http://bsonspec.org/>`__ is a file format used by MongoDB.
The main advantage of this particular file format is its native support for
binary data.  However, space-wise, it is not particularly efficient.  It
also contains a lot of MongoDB specific data types that are not useful
to general audiences.

BsonParser
~~~~~~~~~~

* setRootArray(boolean) basically treats the root ``Document`` as an
  Array instead of an Object in JSON.  It does not verify if the fields
  names are correct.

BsonGenerator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One major disadvantage of the file format is that every ``Document`` and
``Array`` type needs to have its length information generated.  Here I
follow `Bson4Jackson <https://www.michel-kraemer.com/binary-json-with-bson4jackson/>`__ 's approach to generate a stream format that contains
``0``s for the length information.  One can call ``BsonFixLength.fix()`` function
to correct the length information.

``BsonGenerator`` generates a BSON file using a stream operation that does not
have correct lengths for ``Document`` and ``Array`` types.  This format is
identical to Bson4Jackson stream output.  This file can be parsed by
``BsonParser``.

The length information can be fixed by calling ``BsonFixLength.fix()`` function.
